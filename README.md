# arduino
test_WheelsAndSensor --> Moves the weels forward and backward. Tests the sensor (btw IMU needs to be calibrated for good PVM control)
PID_Control --> That's Joe's code for PID Control
pidControlSalim --> My code for PID control
We have 2 PID control files because mine and Joe's are quite different and it would be annoying to work on the same. Cba to work with branches so created 2 files :)

Please feel free to add any useful files on our repo.
